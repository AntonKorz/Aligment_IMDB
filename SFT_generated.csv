0,This movie,"This movie is really bad, which is good to see. There are some good shots, but they are limited in the way the story turns out. It would have been nice to have some of the events that happened a few years back. Some of them are funny, such as when he finds out that the man he kills is a priest. The ending is just stupid, as the priest is able to save the day. If you want a good movie, go and see it, it might make you a better person.<br /><br />It's not as bad as I thought. I'm a big critic of movies, and have watched a lot before, so this is probably one of my favorites. However, the ending doesn't really",-1.6500835418701172

After seeing all the jokes, it's too bad there weren't anything funnier. The acting in this film is so amateurish, I can't even remember what they were talking about -- not even one of the actors is in any real sense good! It's just a waste of money.",-2.537609577178955

It is very exciting and there are a few surprises, but not enough to make the film worthwhile. For those who haven't seen it in theaters, please have a look at this review and see if you will like it. If you get a chance to see it for yourself, get yourself a copy, and look it up on IMDb. I have heard that it is out on DVD and I had the pleasure of buying it myself. In my opinion, it's definitely worth seeing, unless you are an avid wrestling fan and have seen",2.0216522216796875

Not to mention, there are plenty of laughs. <br /><br />8/10 from 9/11Truthout, and it has been said before, that if there ever were a war going on, it would not have been during World War II.

The only reason I didn't bother to watch this movie was because it was way over the top, you just sit there and watch and not really care what happens. This movie just isn't good at all. I have seen over 1000 horror movies and this is nothing more than a bunch of unoriginal movies that are just going to make you feel as though you were made to look like a moron.<br /><br />The only thing that I found really great about this flick was the music, just like the movie, but they did a very good job of putting it together to give you a sense",-2.4173033237457275

It had some nice acting by all the actors and the story moved along very well. I must say that while I enjoyed watching the whole movie, it wasn't as intense as some other Sci-Fi Channel shows I've seen. Overall, I thought this was a good show for kids. My 10 year old doesn't like to watch too much Sci Fi stuff and I really don't think this show will make kids happy. This shows are great fun for adults and it's an interesting show.

I'm so glad the director and writers of the movie made the decision to bring it to life and make a movie that's really fun to watch! My vote is 7/10 and I just can't wait for the DVD release. The movie has such a great cast of characters that you can feel that this film will make you want to sit down and read about them and talk to your friends.

Don't expect a lot of laughs, but there is something for you. If you haven't seen this movie yet then please don't miss it. I would recommend it only if you're going for a good entertainment experience.

I'd be remiss if I did.<br /><br />I would love to see a sequel, and if there's one, make it short and sweet. But, sadly, there aren't any sequels out there.

I have been watching it since I was a child and I didn't know a lot about the plot but I loved it because of the ending.<br /><br />I saw it on DVD and did not have any complaints about it. It was not the best of any horror film but it was better than some of those that I had seen previously. But I wouldn't recommend it, just check it out on the IMDb for some good action/adventure films, for people who have never seen it before, if you see it at your local video store, rent it with a friend and see for yourself.

If you decide to spend a little time with this movie, then all you have to do is watch it again. For what it is worth, I think it's worth watching it for at least one hour if at all possible. Otherwise, you're going to want to just sit back and relax for the rest of those hours, as I did.

In fact, in the opening scene of the movie, we are forced to watch it three times, and at each time, the audience is reminded of how bad the acting was. There is one scene in particular that does exactly what I would expect to see in an hour long movie. It starts out on a very poor note. Not only is the plot not very interesting, yet the scenes are very dull. What kind of movie is this?

It just was so predictable, and I found myself laughing and shaking my head at it all. If you want to see a movie with a story that has a lot of mystery, you will love this. However, there's one aspect that didn't work. The music was horrible, even though I think it's the first time a music video has been made. I've heard that it sounds like an 80's sound track, so the music would sound like the 1980's. Of course, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to rent music videos from",-2.1139230728149414

It is one of my absolute favorite B movies of all time. I would recommend this to anybody who has never seen it, especially if they are looking for real action and suspense. If you do not like comedy, then I suggest you watch this movie because if you like action movies, you'll enjoy it very much, that is, until the last few years.

However, by the end of the day it looks quite good. The movie does have a certain charm to it, especially the music score. It's a little cheesy, but overall for what it is, it's well worth a look.

So, if you think about it, you may not like it at all. But I think you will still find it entertaining. The problem is that, while there are some scenes, the way they are presented, is very poorly done.

Anyway, I can't stress this enough. As much as I enjoy horror, this wasn't a good film and it will probably never see the light of day. However, if only I could give it a 10. That's right.

Instead the characters do what they are told, they make the most of each situation and try to make their mark on the rest. If you didn't get to see this movie yet, I would suggest you give it a look.

First of all, the storyline isn't very good, in fact there's nothing to like about it. The movie is sort of a retelling of MST3K. There is a plot that is well developed, but there is no substance.

It had a lot to do with how the movie was made, as is often the case with so many movies of these kinds. If you look closely, it is very similar to the plot of Taxi Driver. However, if you are lucky enough to have seen it, and have a good idea of what's going to happen, then you'll probably like it more. What's not so great, is the editing.

When he was caught up in the Vietnam war as a war hero, he tried to fight back, but his career was over. In a fit of anger at what he had suffered during that war, the two men decided to form a band of outlaw band members in order to save one of the world's bravest fighting men.

There is only one scene which could have done well in the movie, where one of the kids breaks up with his girlfriend, but that was done very well. So this movie was very enjoyable and if you are a fan of comedies, this one is for you, as well as anyone who is looking for fun, fun entertainment, and a laugh out of nothing. For me, the only reason I gave this film 4/10 is it was so well acted and written.

It is definitely not this bad.

If you want to see a movie with some great acting, this is the way to go. I am looking forward to my next review and I'm sure I'll find something to write about it later.

And of course there's an extended scene in the middle of the cemetery where you see the body lying on the ground, which might not be as gruesome as you might expect.

Otherwise, you won't be disappointed. As for this movie, I really liked it here. It's based on the book by Peter Lorre, by which he teaches us to love ourselves, because we like things to be as they are.

Overall, this isn't my favorite show so I'm giving it a 4/10. There is a good story but I really wish that it went out of its way to be funny. In fact, it doesn't.

The way the story is told gave me an idea for what the main characters did when they were little children.

On the plus side, the story has lots of potential, which is good, because it's something that most movies don't have.

Why was this movie developed? Why did the filmmakers have to think this way before making it? Who was responsible? Did they care what anyone thought of this piece of garbage?

The main plot of the movie is a man who has an accident and when he dies he falls in love with an old lady and she gets married to him, which isn't exactly the case.

After all, I would like to say that there were many good things in the film, especially the ending, even though it was far from perfect.

This movie will help you to understand a big part of what makes life worthwhile, even if the story is not well written or acted out.

This film is based on an actual event, and most people do not know or care about the death of someone they don't know. In contrast, I understand that some people might say that this is a comedy.

Of course, the ending leaves the audience in a state of confusion, unsure what to do next.

Her story is so contrived that the whole film just doesn't connect. It's like trying to tie a piece of rope together and you can't tie the rope, you just cannot connect the pieces.

641,Character development,"Character development is great. Overall, it's a nice piece of film that is worth seeing. But, if you're trying to watch a movie, or want to see someone make a film with a different setting, and/or have a special idea, go ahead. It's worth watching for many reasons, some of them good. The story is interesting, the characters interesting and the movie is very very well made. If you are an independent film-maker, don't waste time on it. Just watch it and see what happens to the rest of the world. I'm sure many people can say that it would be a good investment to rent it as it was originally released, because I think I would like to know if anyone had seen it",2.3540425300598145

I believe it is a good film, if I don't like what I've seen, I will not be able to recommend this film to anyone. This film is definitely worth the watch for all of its flaws. It's a classic of Italian cinema, made in the late 80's I guess. If you really want to know more of a movie, then go and see it! That's definitely the only way to find out what happened to the people who watched the film. You'll never be bored, you won't feel like you've wasted your time.

If you haven't read the book series already, you will probably enjoy this movie, but if you have, I strongly suggest you sit down and take your time and read this novel, just to get a feel for it. Don't waste your precious time watching this crap, because as far as I know this is the second film in the series, and the third coming out a bit earlier than the first. It's not as good as the original as it was, however. This version is only available through Amazon, so don't worry about getting it there, it should be available to the general public.

The fact that it doesn't seem to be about a single person (no one in the family, in fact), makes me very sad. I can say without hesitation that I would like to have been able to see more of this film, and it would have saved a lot more time and effort for my family. <br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies, horror movies or the supernatural.

The performances are very well done, not to mention the script is well written and well executed. Some of this is due to the wonderful acting by the writers and director, though there are definitely a few flaws that remain, particularly in the ending where the plot simply falls apart. Other than that, the whole film is very enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a low-budget, action-packed movie that they can enjoy watching on the big screen and not worry about putting a lot of effort or money into it. In short, it is one of those",1.3012330532073975
646,Character development,"Character development. As with the rest of the films, this one takes a different turn. At first, we see that it is going to be a pretty dark and violent ride. However, as the film progresses and the police arrive on scene, the viewer is introduced to more and more disturbing things. For instance, what we are shown isn't so much of a series of murders and explosions, but rather an entire plot in which an old man has been killed. There are also many scenes that take place at a very high rate of speed, and are often very dangerous. This is a good thing. We don't get to see what the policeman is doing and how he is actually killing people. It helps to give a realistic idea of what is",1.1600580215454102

There is no shortage of characters and an outstanding storyline. It is well made, well written and well shot and I'm sure the film will be loved by even the most diehard horror and sci fi fans alike.

It doesn't take long for the story to come to the fore and the actors to act out their ideas in a way that you can relate to after a while. Not that there wasn't a chance to find out the truth before watching it. The story is well told, it's funny, and it has some moments that aren't often seen in an action movie.

You are being watched, your life is going on and you need to take a deep breath and look at what this world is really like for you to realize that there are things that are wrong but there will always be those things you must change.

It's not much better than other movies i've seen and is a shame that such a low rating is so often given to bad movies.

In fact, the best part of the film was when the camera was actually able to get a good look through the eyes of an audience. It was an absolute joy to see what the director did. I also loved the idea of giving the audience a true sense of ""what they felt"" when they watched the movie. At that point it seemed like the viewer was fully immersed within the proceedings. <br /><br />If you're looking for an enjoyable piece of cinema, then check out The Last House on the Prairie 2.

However, as soon as I realized that I wasn't watching any other kind of movie since the first time I saw it (I haven't read the book ever), I knew that it would be a bad one. I had hoped that if I spent the money to rent it I would pay it in advance, but I ended up buying it and watching it over and over again.

There is also plenty of dialogue that has to do with the story or it wouldn't work for us if it weren't for the plot. I personally saw this movie because it wasn't recommended to me. Many of the scenes seem like they are written by someone in their 30's. This is not for everyone, but it's worth a look. Overall, this is a film that you'll enjoy for a long time. It was recommended as a DVD for those that are looking to see something different and I really recommend it. You'll have a great time and don't let anyone fool you.",1.990767002105713

The film, however, is almost as good as it's title suggests, and if you want a low-budget horror experience, this is it. If not, then it is very, very bad. It isn't a fun film. There are plenty of gore scenes and a lot of blood, just like most films in the genre. Overall, for me, it was the very worst I've ever had the displeasure to watch.

The acting is great, though the story is slow and clunky, which is one reason why the storyline is so complicated. It is also true, that this is a low-budget movie but you can't help but feel a certain satisfaction in the fact that a film of this caliber can be made and sold without the expense of expensive equipment.

It has everything you'd want for a 90 minute movie. Some of the dialog is funny and well-acted, some is over the top. This is not your typical Sci-Fi/Fantasy flick.

Don't bother with the movie, it'll just be too bad it hasn't been as good as you'd hoped for.

If you enjoy action flicks, then you will find this one a pleasure to look at. You will also have a chance of watching this film in the late 70s and early 80s, which are also time periods of great interest to people who love sci-fi.

In fact, the only people who knew more than I do in this movie are that I was on the DVD version and watched the movie.

Also, there is plenty of nudity. There isn't much in the film, other than the usual scenes of being sexually violated and having sex with some pretty young girls, which are also a good part.

Furthermore, while some of the cinematography is excellent (the black and white photography), it is far from convincing.

But for those of you, who are fans of comedy, don't have any problems watching this movie. As far as I'm concerned, you won't regret it, even if you end up laughing too much.

Although the plot might seem simple enough, they succeed and destroy the WTC and its structure. This makes it seem as if they plan on blowing up the towers from the inside.

768,Critical reception,"Critical reception of this film, let alone the success that the film achieved, should have paid tribute to a film in which it could have been more widely appreciated. We have to admit, this isn't Hollywood's first attempt to turn a blind eye, but it has done so much more damage than it's worth, and I'm sorry to say it took me so long to get through. I believe this was the first film I've heard of that wasn't afraid to take an open-minded view of the world. This is not the same film it was a few years earlier.

I was amazed at how good the acting was.<br /><br />I suppose it could have been a lot better, although I don't think I've seen a better story in a very long time. There's so much more to it, it's just a shame. This is a great story about a little girl's journey to a new stage of her life and her struggle to get back at her mother. And I really liked how all the actors are really good and all I could see about them was how they made their roles look real.

Having seen it in its early stages of release in the United States and Europe, I was in awe as to what could be expected from a film like this. It was a surprise to see a great movie with such a wide array of talented actors and a wonderful cast of actors that is truly unique. I'm sure it'll be an even longer and better film than I have ever seen before, if only I had the opportunity to catch it during my own screening of the film.

771,Critical reception,"Critical reception of the movie, and how it was viewed. I was very disappointed. This movie has never been made before, so the fact that it appears to be an English-language version is a little strange, especially for a film that would have been produced in the UK. It also doesn't work for me because I don't think it should be released anywhere in Europe.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to see something that is more American than Canadian, then this isn't the DVD you're looking for. But I won't say it's an American version, instead opting to watch it with the Canadian language subtitles.

It's really a pity because it was released in the 80s and it hasn't had a big screen release yet.

The cast are very good and well-mannered, especially by the actors. They did a great job in conveying the feeling of desperation and loss that most of the characters have.

At the beginning of the movie, we had some vague idea of what we could expect in a good horror film. We had to deal with a guy and girl who are in love with one another but have trouble getting out of their relationship. Later on, they become lovers and start having sex. This would have been scary if they had been living together. Unfortunately,",1.5462013483047485

And, of course, there is plenty of love and acceptance in these relationships. It can get very strange at times, which makes for a very moving film that can be a treat to look at in the long run. But the second half is a much better film to watch, where it becomes clear that the characters are not only connected, they are actually in love.

I saw it as a Christmas present, so I thought it was pretty funny. Well, it doesn't really do that. Even though it's really a fun little film, there are some scenes that just seem too silly.

It felt like the movie was taking place in Paris, maybe in France, but I never thought I would see anything like that again.

Don't even think to rent it unless you need to. If you've got a good time and are ready for a blast of action, then this movie is the way to go.

It seems like everyone involved in the movie had something to do with it. I really thought it was a very poor attempt at horror and it did not deserve the praise that it got. In fact, I have to admit that the actual reason why I give it a 7 out of ten might depend on how much you like your genre.

I don't want to spoil anything, but most of the cast and crew were pretty good. The story is fairly good, with some good performances. It's also interesting to note that there was a number of nudity scenes in this film. This isn't to say that the actors didn't deserve a lot of money, as they certainly did.

The story is based upon the true stories of many people involved in the war, many who died in it, but this is not a piece of pure fiction. Most of these people did not fight. They suffered. Many of them survived. It is a sad irony that the movie never tells the truth about their lives. Not only that, it shows them through a lens of their own reality, so that we can know what they did or how it happened, not only in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and now the Middle East.<br /><br />In the end it is so sad.

But if you ask me, ""What the hell was I thinking?"" The film doesn't do that terribly well and as for the actors, they are all quite convincing in their roles. Robert Duvall is very good as the brother, but I have to admit that the scene where he says he didn't like him is the least memorable in the whole movie. The supporting cast is really good.

Secondly, I'm extremely happy to say that I didn't get bored for most of the movie. The acting was all right, but it's a shame that there wasn't a single scene that made my stomach turn.

If you are a fan of adventure movies (such as the Pirates of the Caribbean) then this should be the movie for you as well. You may be disappointed if you like this kind of movie though.

In fact, what I enjoyed most about it, was seeing how much I needed to learn about myself. I was constantly reminded that my life was based on my beliefs, such as the beliefs of my parents.

The only thing I can think of to recommend for the average moviegoer is that I think the director is very good and the cinematography is stunning. I really enjoyed this film even though I had no idea how they got to this point in their careers. And I also found it difficult to believe that they'd made such a terrible movie that could have been funny and heartwarming even if they had only been able to write it a couple of times.

For example, they are stuck on a boat, which doesn't have engines, and don't know if there's a bridge that's under the water. So they're stuck there and they never really know where the bridge goes or what happens.

Also, the acting is abysmal in this film. It's hard to imagine a better cast for an action flick.

If you want a good film to start with, check out this movie. There are so many plot holes in it you'll want to watch it every time you're on the set, and the only way to end up with something that feels good is to have an actual conversation with someone real close to the movie and make it real, instead of watching it over and over again.

At least three or four of the actors are well known to me and are in their own right. This is a very funny show with very real characters and there is nothing wrong with that.

This is also one of the few films in the genre to have more of an impact on the plot than this one. Even though it isn't a horror film, it still has a lot to offer. The story is strong, and the characters are likable. However, this is one film that I will definitely miss. It's hard not to laugh out loud when watching it. Also, the special effects are atrocious.

However, if you're a fan of John Carpenter's works and you'd like to see more of him, you may find it worth buying, rather than waiting for the next installment in the series to come out, or for horror fans to catch up on what Carpenter has been doing since the first movie ""The Thing"" was released in 1979.

The movie's only flaw is that the acting isn't particularly good. I think it would be better if they had some sort of hero for each character. Instead, there is no hero, it seems like he is the evil one. It wouldn't make much sense if that was the primary villain, unless that villain had been killed by the same villain in the first half that we have seen before.

There's also a decent acting performance by Toni Collette, but I think that's not enough to convince me that this movie was made in the 1940's.

Also, the cinematography is OK, although I don't like to look at the camera, I can't tell you why. The direction is good and the dialogs are very fast.

However, it needs a lot more than that and it's well worth watching if you are looking forward to watching it.

Another reason why the acting was good was that I thought the actors were great and that their voices were very well developed.

For the younger generation it may have been a dream come true for them.

It looks terrible on the screen, and it wouldn't even have done a damn thing to make the people at the theater hear it. There was a lot of shouting and laughter, which is quite funny considering that many of the characters were supposed to die in those terrible scenes. Plus, the acting is terrible.

There are lots of scenes where there is little to no comedy going on, which is why the director wanted to avoid that kind of stuff. However, it is a much better film than what you get from this one.

There are no scenes of the actual movie that are worth watching, because most of what we are supposed to be watching is a bad movie with bad acting from the writers and directors.

There's no realistic character development, nor any sense that his/her story will end any time soon after being discovered. All that is necessary in order to make this a believable story.

However, in fact it's a completely different story which has a lot to offer. There are lots of interesting elements which have been introduced into the screenplay which are very important to the story. Also, I also liked the idea that there were two separate stories which were different and did not interfere with the overall plot. Overall, a terrific film that should be enjoyed by anyone.

1912,Documentary,"Documentary, it is a film-within-film. It has some of the best scenes of any movie, and it has an excellent storyline. The only thing the film is lacking, is the soundtrack. There are quite a few songs sung by the actors. Also, there is hardly any acting. For example, when they play the music, I don't think I can really tell if the movie is about the real events of WW2 or if it's about a real person. If I thought it was about Hitler, how could I have been so wrong?<br /><br />Of course, the special effects are very well done.

This was by far, the worst of all the characters I saw, and at times, even I was not in the right mind to see them. They were just annoying.

I guess it's because it only takes about 45 minutes of your life to sit through all of it, but for me, even that's enough time to fully enjoy the movie and enjoy watching it again and again. In my opinion, it is a shame that Hollywood hasn't given more material to film makers. It's not that they didn't make a good film to work with. They just don't seem that good at it anymore because of the way they are making their films and for that matter, the characters. The movie is so weak, so predictable",-2.1790270805358887

If this is the case, the documentary is a textbook example of the ""Good and Evil"" myth, and it doesn't do justice to the film's portrayal of America in the context of today's post-WW2 America.

Do yourself a favor: do not watch it until you can get past the first 3/4 of what you remember. Once you've done that, you will truly feel sorry for yourself.

I also think it is a very moving, emotional film, the kind of film that does not rely on melodrama or violence, but turns it into a meaningful and thoughtful work of art.

The problem is that I'm not a huge fan of the genre as a whole. This is about a bunch of teenagers trying to decide whether to live in the future or not after all.

Otherwise, watch anything else, as this one is just too far fetched. <br /><br />This is a film with a low budget and a very low level of technical quality.

This is perhaps the most original film we've seen in 40 years. There are still some holes that need to be corrected. I've never seen this type of work before. While it might look like a great film (which it was), the dialog and music are a little choppy and uninteresting. The plot is a bit weak, and I can't really relate to the story because it's just plain bad. Still, it comes across as something to watch once you start watching it.

There's so much going on that makes this a very entertaining movie. The cinematography is fine, which is a plus, as well. Don't waste your time on this movie and just watch it in its entirety. You'll laugh and cry the whole time. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a little more comedy to watch, or who just wants to see a movie with nothing but laughs.

I found the dialogs a bit slow in a way that I felt it was not done very well.

Also, the acting was horrendous. At times it felt fake, which was a problem with most movies.

It's a shame that many people didn't appreciate the story, as it is so bad that it's really hard to figure out what's going on. The acting here is simply awful.

There's not much that could have been explained on any level better. It's probably a stretch to call this a bad film, but its a waste of time and money. Overall, a horrible film.

I'll give it a 10 out of ten and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in old-school Sci-Fi/Fantasy. This is just the best film I can think of",1.5342174768447876
2293,Animated films,"Animated films have a bad reputation, at best, but I think that's because they do so without really thinking about the characters or the plot. There are plenty of movies that try to make us empathize with them by making us think like they did for us. That is what this movie does, and I am grateful for it. However, the movie itself is not what it should have been. I feel that the director, who is a huge fan of MST3K, should at least have tried to portray the atmosphere of the film more realistically and more subtly. It was very hard to imagine that something as bad as this film could possibly be happening to the viewer. The fact that it was filmed in Seattle, or New York City",-0.6161332130432129
2294,Animated films,"Animated films are a good thing, and if this is the case it could have been better. I am not saying the film was terrible, but the acting and cinematography was horrible. The actors are terrible. There is no plot to speak of, which is why I can't see why the actors were given the names they did. This film seems to be an afterthought on the part of directors who thought this was the worst thing they've ever done in the history of the medium. It is a pity that Hollywood didn't take their time, as it would have cost them to make a better movie. If this movie is anything like any other made by this industry, they should be ashamed for making it. They have done a poor job",-2.5631399154663086
2295,Animated films,"Animated films are not meant to be watched by people with the slightest idea how to view a movie and you don't have to sit through every movie. There are a bunch of great movies out there that have never made it into the public domain. I'm glad to say this, but I'd like to note that I do not recommend this movie to anyone who has ever watched a film, even if they are unfamiliar with some of the actors and situations. If you are one of those people who is familiar with a particular scene, and think it will be interesting or make you think, it is not the film to watch! It's just not what you'd expect, unless you're someone that has seen a handful of such movies and want to",-0.9573122262954712
2296,Animated films,"Animated films in the early 70's, I think this is a must for anyone. But I must say I actually enjoyed it quite a bit at first.<br /><br />When I first saw the film the first time, it was a great film. I saw it on a Saturday afternoon, after a holiday, and I was really excited. However, that was about a week before I could see it at the cinema, so the movie got a lot of attention. It was amazing how quickly I got into watching this film and being like ""oh, this guy is great!"" I also loved that the story was told from the point of view of a young girl who is obsessed with the boy in her class. So I really enjoyed watching",2.4097557067871094
2297,Animated films,"Animated films have always been somewhat of a niche in the early 20th century, but this is definitely one of them. I have often wondered if it is the use of special effects that makes a good film special. It is a movie to watch with friends and a group of people. In this case I can't imagine why there are so many people with the same facial expressions and expressions that are considered normal in cinema today. However, there is nothing wrong with this movie! In fact, I am a fan of visual effects and I enjoy watching them for the most part.<br /><br />The story of the main character has to do with finding a way to overcome the obstacles that come up with his life that he must overcome at the",2.207892894744873
2298,Animated films,"Animated films of the early 20th century could not have been any better. What this film has done is to create a narrative about what it means to be a man in this age, and how he looks in the face of adversity. All of a sudden we get a movie that is truly engaging and thought-provoking, with some really heart-warming moments. It shows a young man struggling to cope and living a life with his family, friends and family. There's a very sad ending to this story and makes you wonder, why we are so ready to fight for all of our freedom.<br /><br />This film is a film that I would really recommend to those who have lived through the Great Depression or any other times of",2.2615718841552734
2299,Animated films,"Animated films are hard to watch because all of the actors are very young. They don't act like teenagers, not that they do anything interesting, but there are enough actors in the story to keep you guessing until you've seen the movie over and over. This film is definitely worth watching if you're a teenager and want to see an animated film. It doesn't need to cost anything, it just needs money. If you can get your hands on a copy, feel free to rent it. I can't think of anyone better to direct a feature length film from. In my opinion this is the best, funniest and best kept secret movie ever released to date!<br /><br />Rating: 4/10 I saw this film",2.233956813812256
